            <li>3-3/4 cups confectioners' sugar</li>

            <li>In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Combine the flour, cinnamon, cloves, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add to the creamed mixture alternately with buttermilk, beating well after each addition. Fold in cherries and pecans.</li>
            <li>Transfer batter to prepared pans. Bake at 350° for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
            <li>For frosting, in a large bowl, beat cream cheese until fluffy. Add confectioners’ sugar and enough water to achieve spreading consistency. Tint with food coloring if desired.
